* Henning Holm (@HenningHolmDE) fixed the Gitpod.io setup. [You can now develop `TVrank`
  in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fredmorcos/tvrank/).
* Command-line option parsing has been reworked, search-related options can still come
  before and after a sub-command, but global options can only come before a sub-command.

* Tim Heaney (@oylenshpeegul) ported `TVrank` from `structopt` to `clap`. `structopt` is
  in maintenance mode and almost all of its features were moved to `clap` version 3.
* @caglarkaya added some tests to the internal `TVrank` library.
* The `NO_COLOR` environment variable can now be set to 0 for disabling
  it, or any other value for enabling it.
  * Example: `NO_COLOR=0 tvrank ...`
  * By @fredmorcos
* `TVrank` will now exit with code `1` when an error occurs.
  * By @fredmorcos
* @fredmorcos added more command-line help text.
* @fredmorcos fixed the buggy display of the total number of results vs. the number of
  displayed results when the `--top` command-line argument was being used.
* The `TVrank` library is now slightly easier to use when querying using keywords: the
  lifetime of the keywords slice is no longer attached to the lifetime of the returned
  iterator over the results.
  * By @fredmorcos
* An issue was fixed when the search query contained the sub-string "the" as part of a
  larger word.
  * By @fredmorcos
* A new sub-command called `mark` was added and documented in the `README` to make marking
  directories with a `tvrank.json` file easier.

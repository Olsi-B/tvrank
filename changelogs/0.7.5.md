* Tim Heaney (@oylenshpeegul) ported `TVrank` from `structopt` to `clap`. `structopt` is
  in maintenance mode and almost all of its features were moved to `clap` version 3.
* @caglarkaya added some tests to the internal `TVrank` library.
* The `NO_COLOR` environment variable can now be set to 0 for disabling
  it, or any other value for enabling it.
  * Example: `NO_COLOR=0 tvrank ...`
  * By @fredmorcos
* @fredmorcos fixed the buggy display of the total number of results vs. the number of
  displayed results when the `--top` command-line argument was being used.

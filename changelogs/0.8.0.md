* The `title` sub-command has been renamed to `search`.
* The `movies-dir` and `series-dir` sub-commands have been renamed to `scan-movies` and
  `scan-series`, respectively.
* Documentation updates to the `db` module.
* This release fixes an issue with the `mark` sub-command writing in correct `tvrank.json`
  files. The incorrect `tvrank.json` files looked like this:

  ```json
  {
    "imdb": {
      "id": {
        "title_id": "ttXXXXX"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  While the correct `tvrank.json` files should like this:

  ```json
  {
    "imdb": {
      "id": "ttXXXXXX"
    }
  }
  ```

* This release also fixes an issue (#54) with IMDB IDs that end with non-numeric
  characters being accepted. Example: `ttXXXXXabc` where XXXX are digits.
